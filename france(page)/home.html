    <h1>France</h1>
    <h3>
        France is my favorite country because everything about it feels so stylish and timeless. The French language is beautiful and has this romantic flow to it that I love.<br>
        Fashion there is on another level—people just know how to put together effortlessly chic outfits. Plus, French traditions, whether it’s enjoying a long meal or the way they celebrate art and culture, really appeal to me.<br>
        There’s this charm in how they balance modern life with holding onto their history and values, which is something I really admire.

    <h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
    <h3>
        The Eiffel Tower is such an iconic symbol of France, and I can’t help but love it! It’s amazing how this giant iron structure captures the heart of Paris.<br>
        I love the way it sparkles at night; it adds a magical touch to the city. Whether you're enjoying a picnic on the Champ de Mars or just gazing up at it from the streets, there’s something special about being around the tower.<br>
        It’s a must-see for anyone visiting, and it really makes you feel the romance and charm of Paris!

    <h2>Boris Lumé Boulangerie</h2>
    <h3>
        Boris Lumé Boulangerie is such a cute spot in *Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir*! It’s not just any bakery; it’s where Marinette and her friends hang out, and it always feels so cozy and welcoming.<br>
        Boris is like the sweetest guy, always ready with a smile and the most delicious pastries. I love how it’s a place where Marinette can escape her superhero life for a bit and just be herself.<br>
        Plus, the bakery is filled with so much charm and Parisian flair—who wouldn’t want to grab a croissant there?<br>
        It really captures the magic of friendship and community in the show!
